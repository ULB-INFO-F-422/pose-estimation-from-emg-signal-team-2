    "We also need to prevents data leaking so we can't use a methode who use the windows of one session for training AND validation because we have overlapping data in each session, two windows in the same session can share the same datas, and if these two windows are in train and validation, it will lead to data leakage and overly optimistic performance (data in the train set will also be in the validation set). \n",
    "\n",
    "So it's naturally that we have chosen the \"Leave One Group Out\" method, this method will use each session as the validation set once and the other for training. We completly prevent data leakage because each session is indepandent from the other, and we reduce the bias because each session will be used for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, \"LOGO\" and \"GroupKFold(5)\" produce the same splits, but we choose \"LOGO\" because it's more explicit, readers will immediatly see that we use one session for validation each time while \"GroupKFold\" need to have 5 in parameter to do the same thong"

    "\n",
    "##### Simple model\n",
    "We started by a simple model composed of 3 linear layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate it, we used Skorch, which lets us plug a PyTorch nn.Module into a sklearn function.\n",
    "Thanks to Skorch, we could reuse our existing cross_validation_with_scores() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rmse mean was 17.03, which beat the vanilla lasso model but not the covriance matrices lasso. We analyzed the value of the training loss and validation loss for each epoch and we saw that the model is underfitting.\n",
    "So we decide to complexify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "We upgraded to a small CNN with three 1D convolutional layers because the dataset has to much datas for an nn classique and to automatically learn local temporal patterns in the EMG signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "After each convolutional layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "We normalize our data to stabilize and speed up training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a simple Relu activation so the network can learn more complex features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We “cut” the time dimension in half, keeping only the strongest responses and reducing data size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the three convolutional blocks are done, we flatten the output tensor and pass it into a two layer head, to convert these extracted features into the 51 joint-angle predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Early stopping and LR scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "We added two Skorch callbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "-EarlyStopping to stop the training when no improvement is seen for 5 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-LRScheduler to cut the learning rate by half when the validation loss stalls 3 epochs consecutives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination prevents wasted epochs once the model converges and refines the learning rate to squeeze out extra gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Batch size reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We lowered the batch size from 128 to 64. Using smaller batches adds a bit of randomness to each weight update, which helps the model generalize better without altering its structure.\n",
    "\n",

    "At this point we have our ensemble predictions (y_ensemble) and all the metrics we need for the average method. The power of this approach depends not only on each models individual performance but also on the diversity of their errors. Because we weight every model equally, a very weak model can drag the average down.\n",

    "However, when all the models are accurate enough and make different kinds of mistakes, averaging becomes extremely effective. For example, our CNN excels at learning local, spatial patterns in the raw filtered signal, while our nn + covariance network captures global statistical dependencies over time. Their errors rarely coincide, so when the CNN prediction is off for a given sample, the nn model often compensates it, and vice-versa. By averaging their outputs, we reduce the total variance and achieve a lower rmse/nmse than either model on its own, all without any extra hyperparameter tuning\n"
